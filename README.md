# pands-weekly-tasks

This project is submitted for the Programming and Scripting module of the course Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics.

## About This Project
This project served as a practical application of the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the Programming and Scripting module. Over the span of the initial 8 weeks, a series of small tasks were assigned, each tailored to correspond with the topics covered during that week's instruction.

Each task, written in Python, aimed to implement and explore a specific function of the Python language. Often requiring research beyond the lecture material, these programs fostered independent thinking and problem-solving skills among the participants.

The project encompasses a total of 8 programs, outlined as follows:

Week 01: helloworld.py

A program that prints the string "Hello World!".

Week 02: bank.py

A program where the user inputs two monetary amounts (in cents), adds them, and prints the result in a human-readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

Week 03: accounts.py

This program reads in a 10-character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

Week 04: collatz.py

A program that prompts the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation: At each step, calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends if the current value is one.

Week 05: weekday.py

A program that informs the user whether the current day is a weekday or a weekend.

Week 06: squareroot.py

This program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

Week 07: es.py

 program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of occurrences of the letter 'e' it contains.

Week 08: plottask.py

A program that displays a histogram of a normal distribution of 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, along with a plot of the function h(x) = x^3 in the range 0 to 10.


This structured approach not only reinforced the concepts taught in the lectures but also encouraged students to delve deeper into Python's capabilities, enhancing their proficiency and fostering a spirit of inquiry.

## Use of This Project
This project is useful as a practical learning experience for students who are learning the fundamentals of computer programming. The project covers key functions of Python, allowing independent thinking and problem-solving skills to flourish.
Through completing the tasks covered in the project, users can become proficient in the language and can gain confidence in their abilities to solve problems in real-world scenarios.

## Get Started
To get started with this project, users need an up-to-date version of Python installed on their systems. They can then download or clone the "pands-weekly-tasks" repository directly from GitHub. Each program corresponds to a specific week's task. Users are encouraged to modify scripts to further improve the programs.

## Get Help
For assistance, users can refer to the comments within the programs, providing insights into the written code. Additional clarification can be found in the Python documentation available at https://docs.python.org/3/, or through numerous tutorials on Python, accessible on the W3Schools website at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp.
